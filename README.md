# Conway's *Game of Life* with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

A Jupyter notebook implementation of Conway's *Game of Life* with a CNN, using Python 3.5 with NumPy and Keras. Please be aware that GitHub's Notebook Viewer doesn't render any of the SVG diagrams nor does it process the LaTeX code correctly. Therefore, I have included an [HTML rendering](https://cdn.rawgit.com/rhaver/conways-game-of-life-with-cnn/ca74992e/Conway's%20Game%20of%20Life%20with%20CNN.html).
