# Conway's *Game of Life* with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

A Jupyter notebook implementation of Conway's *Game of Life* with a CNN, using Python 3.5 with NumPy and Keras. Please be aware that GitHub's Notebook Viewer doesn't render any of the SVG diagrams nor does it process the LaTeX code correctly, so please open it in Jupyter. I have included an [HTML rendering](Conway%27s%20Game%20of%20Life%20with%20CNN.html), but it does not preview on GitHub.
